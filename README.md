# Word2Vec and Self-Attention Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, `Word2Vec_and_Self_Attention.ipynb`, that demonstrates the use of Word2Vec embeddings and self-attention mechanisms in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It combines traditional word embedding techniques with modern attention mechanisms to enhance the analysis of textual data.

## Features

- **Word2Vec Embeddings**:
  - Use pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings or train custom embeddings with the `gensim` library.
  - Explore semantic relationships through vector arithmetic and similarity analysis.

- **Self-Attention Mechanisms**:
  - Implement a basic self-attention module to highlight important words in sentences.
  - Combine embeddings with attention scores for improved NLP workflows.

- **Applications**:
  - Text classification using embeddings and attention mechanisms.
  - Similarity and analogy analysis using Word2Vec.
  - Sentence weighting with attention scores for downstream tasks.

## Datasets

The notebook is designed to work with the following datasets:

- **Custom Text Data**:
  - Users can provide their own datasets in `.txt` or similar formats for embedding training and attention analysis.

- **Pre-trained Word2Vec Embeddings**:
  - Google News Word2Vec (available via `gensim` API).

- **Sample Datasets for Attention Mechanisms**:
  - Example sentences demonstrating the impact of attention scores on word importance.

Ensure your datasets are properly preprocessed (tokenized, cleaned, and normalized) for accurate results.

## Prerequisites

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
